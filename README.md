php-sklik
=========

Example using XML-RPC to communicate with Sklik API (http://www.sklik.cz/)

XML-RPC library used here: https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/
It required some work with fixing DateTime support, so it is contained together with this example.

For usage example, see sklik_tutorial.php.
